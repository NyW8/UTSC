//Quest 2
//Overloading
//	- two methods that have the same name but different parameters
//	- one can be a default, and the other can call it, or they can process inputs differently, etc
//	- must be inside the same class
//	- interfaces are clearer to work with
//		- I DONT FULLY UNDERSTAND INTERFACE VS CLASS

//Static
//	- means you can have (for example) one variable that each instance of a class shares
//	- make good counters, etc
//	- kind of like global variables, but better
//	- static variables can be inside any methods
//	- regular variables CANNOT be inside static methods

//toString and equals pt 1
//	- toString has an default method already created for each object
//		- can create your own toString method that overrides default
//		- all object types have a toString method
//	- equals has a default method already created for each object
//		- like toString, can override default
