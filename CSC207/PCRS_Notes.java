//Quest 1
//Hello World
//  - No code exists outside a class
//	- There are no functions, but methods exists
	public static void main(String[] args){}
//	- when a class is run, this method is automatically called
//	- public declares what has access to that object
	System.out.println(5+7);
//	- System is the class
//	- out is a static member in the class
//	- println is a method within that member
//	- 5+7 is the expression


//Variables
	int i;						//default value for int is 0
	Object obj;					//default value for any object is null
	String name = "CSC207";		//note the capital 'S' and double quotes
	boolean isTrue = false;		//lowercase boolean values (true/false)
	double gpa = 0.0;
