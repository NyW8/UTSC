This is a repository to hold some testing and files for different assignments from my UTSC undergraduate experience.

Feel free to use these testing files but please know that like many humans, I also have bugs in my code sometimes.

So...
Disclaimer:
These do not mean that the project is correct if they work. These do not mean that I have tested EVERY possible case. These are just to help me understand what is going on and how to better test for the assignments. Also, it is not guaranteed that your professors are even using the same assignments, so there's that too.
