This is a test file to test your A3. It creates 6 files: cascade1pipe, cascade2pipes, cascade3pipes, and then the same for biquad. It works by taking the output of biquad piped to itself and comparing it to the same values given to cascade. It also creates a file called 'totalfile'. In order to test if you biquad is correct compared to others, you can run this test file and use the 'diff' command to see if there are differences between someone else's totalfile and your own.
